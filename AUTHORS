The clever Smart Drag idea was suggested by Joe Betts.  Thanks, Joe!

The idea for MouseTool came to me when I was thinking about
head-tracking systems that allow you to move a cursor using
your head orientation, and then send clicks when you pause.
As far as I know, I was the first person to use this technique
with an ordinary mouse, but it is possible that I am wrong about that.
There are now other programs available for Windows and Macs that
do this; I know that some were developed after MouseTool, but
it is likely others came before.

Other ideas in MouseTool for Windows that I hope to port to KDE were
either suggested by MouseTool users or came out of email discussions
with users.
